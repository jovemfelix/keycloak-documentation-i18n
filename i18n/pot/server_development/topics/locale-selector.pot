"By default, the locale is selected using the `DefaultLocaleSelectorProvider` "
"which implements the `LocaleSelectorProvider` interface. English is the "
"default language when internationalization is disabled.  With "
"internationalization enabled, the locale is resolved according to the logic "
"described in the link:{adminguide_link}"
"#_user_locale_selection[{adminguide_name}]."

"This behaviour can be changed through the `LocaleSelectorSPI` by "
"implementing the `LocaleSelectorProvider` and "
"`LocaleSelectorProviderFactory`."

"The `LocaleSelectorProvider` interface has a single method, `resolveLocale`, "
"which must return a locale given a `RealmModel` and a nullable `UserModel`. "
"The actual request is available from the `KeycloakSession#getContext` method."

#. type: Plain text

"Custom implementations can extend the `DefaultLocaleSelectorProvider` in "
"order to reuse parts of the default behaviour. For example to ignore the "
"`Accept-Language` request header, a custom implementation could extend the "
"default provider, override it's `getAcceptLanguageHeaderLocale`, and return "
"a null value. As a result the locale selection will fall back on the "
"realms's default language."
