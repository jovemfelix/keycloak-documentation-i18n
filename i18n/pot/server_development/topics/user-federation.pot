"The keycloak examples directory contains an example of a simple User "
"Federation Provider backed by a simple properties file. See `providers/"
"federation-provider` in the examples distribution. Most of how to create a "
"federation provider is explained directly within the example code, but some "
"information is here too."

"Writing a User Federation Provider starts by implementing the "
"`UserFederationProvider` and `UserFederationProviderFactory` interfaces. "
"Please see the Javadoc and example for complete details on how to do this."

"Some important methods of note: getUserByUsername() and getUserByEmail() "
"require that you query your federated storage and if the user exists create "
"and import the user into Keycloak storage. How much metadata you import is "
"fully up to you. This import is done by invoking methods on the object "
"returned by `KeycloakSession.userFederatedStorage()` to add and import user "
"information. The proxy() method will be called whenever Keycloak has found "
"an imported UserModel.  This allows the federation provider to proxy the "
"UserModel which is useful if you want to support external storage updates on "
"demand."
