msgid "SAML Role Mappings SPI"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"{project_name} defines a SPI for mapping SAML roles into roles that exist in "
"the SP environment. The roles returned by a third-party IDP might not always "
"correspond to the roles that were defined for the SP application so there is "
"a need for a mechanism that allows mapping the SAML roles into different "
"roles. It is used by the SAML adapter after it extracts the roles from the "
"SAML assertion to set up the container's security context."

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The `org.keycloak.adapters.saml.RoleMappingsProvider` SPI doesn't impose any "
"restrictions on the mappings that can be performed.  Implementations can not "
"only map roles into other roles but also add or remove roles (and thus "
"augment or reduce the set of roles assigned to the SAML principal) depending "
"on the use case."

"To implement a custom role mappings provider one first needs to implement "
"the `org.keycloak.adapters.saml.RoleMappingsProvider` interface. Then, a "
"`META-INF/services/org.keycloak.adapters.saml.RoleMappingsProvider` file "
"containing the fully qualified name of the custom implementation must be "
"added to the archive that also contains the implementation class. This "
"archive can be:"

"When the SP application is deployed, the role mappings provider that will be "
"used is selected by the id that was set in `keycloak-saml.xml` or in the "
"`keycloak-saml` subsystem. So to enable your custom provider simply make "
"sure that its id is properly set in the adapter configuration."
