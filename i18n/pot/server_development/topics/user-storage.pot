"You can use the User Storage SPI to write extensions to {project_name} to "
"connect to external user databases and credential stores. The built-in LDAP "
"and ActiveDirectory support is an implementation of this SPI in action. Out "
"of the box, {project_name} uses its local database to create, update, and "
"look up users and validate credentials. Often though, organizations have "
"existing external proprietary user databases that they cannot migrate to "
"{project_name}'s data model. For those situations, application developers "
"can write implementations of the User Storage SPI to bridge the external "
"user store and the internal user object model that {project_name} uses to "
"log in users and manage them."

"When the {project_name} runtime needs to look up a user, such as when a user "
"is logging in, it performs a number of steps to locate the user. It first "
"looks to see if the user is in the user cache; if the user is found it uses "
"that in-memory representation. Then it looks for the user within the "
"{project_name} local database. If the user is not found, it then loops "
"through User Storage SPI provider implementations to perform the user query "
"until one of them returns the user the runtime is looking for. The provider "
"queries the external user store for the user and maps the external data "
"representation of the user to {project_name}'s user metamodel."

"User Storage SPI provider implementations can also perform complex criteria "
"queries, perform CRUD operations on users, validate and manage credentials, "
"or perform bulk updates of many users at once. It depends on the "
"capabilities of the external store."

"User Storage SPI provider implementations are packaged and deployed "
"similarly to (and often are) Java EE components. They are not enabled by "
"default, but instead must be enabled and configured per realm under the "
"`User Federation` tab in the administration console."
