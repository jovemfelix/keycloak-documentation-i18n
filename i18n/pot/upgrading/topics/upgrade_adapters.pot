"As mentioned above, we try to support newer release versions of "
"{project_name} server working with older release versions of the adapters.  "
"However, in some cases we need to include fixes on the {project_name} server "
"side which may break compatibility with older versions of the adapters. For "
"example, when we implement new aspects of the OpenID Connect specification, "
"which older client adapter versions were not aware of."

"In those cases, we added Compatibility modes. For OpenId Connect clients, "
"there is a section named `OpenID Connect Compatibility Modes` in the "
"{project_name} admin console, on the page with client details. Here, you can "
"disable some new aspects of the {project_name} server to preserve "
"compatibility with older client adapters. More details are available in the "
"tool tips of individual switches."
