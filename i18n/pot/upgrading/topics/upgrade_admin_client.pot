"It is important that you upgrade the {project_name} server first, and then "
"upgrade the admin-client. Earlier versions of the admin-client might work "
"with later versions of {project_name} server, but earlier versions of "
"{project_name} server might not work with later versions of the admin-"
"client. It is recommended to use the admin-client version that matches the "
"used {project_name} server version."
