"flows, which requires attention during migration."

msgid "REQUIRED and ALTERNATIVE executions not supported at same authentication flow"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Previously, it was possible to have REQUIRED and ALTERNATIVE executions in "
"the same authentication flow at the same level. There were some issues with "
"this approach and we did the refactoring in the Authentication SPI, which "
"means that this is no longer valid. If ALTERNATIVE and REQUIRED executions "
"are configured at the same level, the ALTERNATIVE executions are considered "
"disabled."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"So when migrating to this version, your existing authentication flows will "
"be migrated but retain the behavior of the previous version. If an "
"authentication flow contains ALTERNATIVE executions at the same level as "
"REQUIRED executions, the ALTERNATIVE executions are added to the separate "
"REQUIRED subflow."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"This strategy should ensure the same or similar behavior of the each "
"authentication flow as in the previous version. However, you may review the "
"configuration of your authentication flow and double check that it works as "
"expected. This recommendation applies in particular for customized "
"authentication flows with custom authenticator implementations."
msgstr ""

#. type: Labeled list
#, no-wrap
msgid "OPTIONAL execution requirement removed"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Regarding migration, the most important change is removing support for the "
"OPTIONAL requirement from authentication executions and replacing it with "
"the CONDITIONAL requirement, which allows more flexibility."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"OPTIONAL authenticators configured in the previous version are replaced with "
"the CONDITIONAL subflows. These subflows have the Condition - User "
"Configured condition configured as first execution, and the previously "
"OPTIONAL authenticator (for example OTP Form) as second execution. For the "
"user, the behavior during authentication matches the behavior of the "
"previous version."

"The interface Authenticator is not changed, but you may be affected if you "

"CredentialValidator."

"We added more flexibility around storing user credentials. Among other "

"multiple OTP credentials. Some changes exist in the database schema in "
"relation to that, however the credentials from the previous version are "
"updated to the new format. Users can still log in with the passwords or OTP "
"credentials defined in the previous version."

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"In the previous releases, developers were allowed to provide client "
"credentials to the JavaScript adapter. For now on, this capability was "
"removed, because client-side apps are not safe to keep secrets.  Ability to "
"propagate prompt=none to default IDP"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"We have added a switch in the OIDC identity provider configuration named "
"Accepts prompt=none forward from client to identify IDPs that are able to "
"handle forwarded requests that include the prompt=none query parameter."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Until now, when receiving an auth request with prompt=none, a realm would "
"return a login_required error if the user is not authenticated in the realm "
"without checking if the user has been authenticated by an IDP. From now on, "
"if a default IDP can be determined for the auth request (either by the use "
"of the kc_idp_hint query param or by setting up a default IDP for the realm) "
"and if the Accepts prompt=none forward from client switch has been enabled "
"for the IDP, the auth request is forwarded to the IDP to check if the user "
"has been authenticated there."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"It is important to note that this switch is only taken into account if a "
"default IDP is specified, in which case we know where to forward the auth "
"request without having to prompt the user to select an IDP. If a default IDP "
"cannot be determined, we cannot assume which one will be used to fulfill the "
"auth request so the request forwarding is not performed."
