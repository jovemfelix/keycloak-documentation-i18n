"Existing deployments using this broker may start experiencing errors when "
"fetching user's profile using version 2 of LinkedIn APIs. This error may be "

"API or request specific OAuth2 scopes during the authentication process."

#. type: Plain text

"Even for newly created LinkedIn client applications, you need to make sure "

"Due to these privacy restrictions imposed by LinkedIn in regards to access "

"member's email address as the default username. That means that the "
