"If the IdP requires that the client application (or SP) sign all of its "
"requests and/or if the IdP will encrypt assertions, you must define the keys "
"used to do this.  For client-signed documents you must define both the "
"private and public key or certificate that is used to sign documents.  For "
"encryption, you only have to define the private key that is used to decrypt "
"it."

"The `Key` element has two optional attributes `signing` and `encryption`.  "
"When set to true these tell the adapter what the key will be used for.  If "
"both attributes are set to true, then the key will be used for both signing "
"documents and decrypting encrypted assertions.  You must set at least one of "
"these attributes to true."
