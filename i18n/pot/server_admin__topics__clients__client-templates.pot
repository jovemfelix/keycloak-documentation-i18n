"If you have a lot of applications you need to secure and register within "
"your organization it can become quite tedious to configure the <<_protocol-"
"mappers, protocol mappers>> and <<_client_scope, scope>> for each of these "
"clients.  {project_name} allows you to define shared client configuration in "
"an entity called a _client template_."

"To create a template click the `Create` button.  This brings you to a simple "
"screen in which you name the template and hit save.  A _client template_ "
"will have similar tabs to regular clients.  You'll be able to define "
"<<_protocol-mappers, protocol mappers>> and <<_client_scope, scope>> which "
"can be inherited by other clients."

"Having a client inherit from a template is as simple as choosing the "
"template from the `Client Template` drop down list on either the `Add "
"Client` or client `Settings` tab.  You will see the `Mappers` and `Scope` "
"tabs get additional switches which allow you to turn on or off inheriting "
"from the parent template."
