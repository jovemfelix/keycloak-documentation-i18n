"With clickjacking, a malicious site loads the target site in a transparent "
"iFrame overlaid on top of a set of dummy buttons that are carefully "
"constructed to be placed directly under important buttons on the target "
"site.  When a user clicks a visible button, they are actually clicking a "
"button (such as a \"login\" button) on the hidden page.  An attacker can "
"steal a user's authentication credentials and access their resources."

"By default, every response by {project_name} sets some specific browser "
"headers that can prevent this from happening.  Specifically, it sets https://"
"tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034[X-FRAME_OPTIONS] and http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/"
"[Content-Security-Policy].  You should take a look at the definition of both "
"of these headers as there is a lot of fine-grain browser access you can "
"control.  In the admin console you can specify the values these headers will "
"have.  Go to the `Realm Settings` left menu item and click the `Security "
"Defenses` tab and make sure you are on the `Headers` sub-tab."
