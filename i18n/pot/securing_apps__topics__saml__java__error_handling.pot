"{project_name} has some error handling facilities for servlet based client "
"adapters.  When an error is encountered in authentication, the client "
"adapter will call `HttpServletResponse.sendError()`.  You can set up an "
"`error-page` within your `web.xml` file to handle the error however you "
"want.  The client adapter can throw 400, 401, 403, and 500 errors."
