"Beyond verbosity of exchanged data, if you compare the specifications you'll "
"find that OIDC was designed to work with the web while SAML was retrofitted "
"to work on top of the web.  For example, OIDC is also more suited for HTML5/"
"JavaScript applications because it is easier to implement on the client side "
"than SAML. As tokens are in the JSON format, they are easier to consume by "
"JavaScript. You will also find several nice features that make implementing "
"security in your web applications easier. For example, check out the link:"
"http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0."
"html#ChangeNotification[iframe trick] that the specification uses to easily "
"determine if a user is still logged in or not."

"SAML has its uses though. As you see the OIDC specifications evolve you see "
"they implement more and more features that SAML has had for years. What we "
"often see is that people pick SAML over OIDC because of the perception that "
"it is more mature and also because they already have existing applications "
"that are secured with it."
