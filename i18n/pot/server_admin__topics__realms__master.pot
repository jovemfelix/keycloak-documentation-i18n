"When you boot {project_name} for the first time a pre-defined realm is "
"created for you.  This initial realm is called the _master_ realm and is the "
"king of all realms.  Admins in this realm have permissions to view and "
"manage any other realm created on the server instance.  When you define your "
"initial admin account, you are creating an account in the _master_ realm.  "
"Your initial login to the admin console will also be through the _master_ "
"realm."

"It is recommended that you do not use the _master_ realm to manage the users "
"and applications in your organization.  Keep the _master_ realm as a place "
"for _super_ admins to create and manage the realms in your system.  This "
"keeps things clean and organized."

"It is possible to disable the _master_ realm and define admin accounts at "
"each individual new realm you create.  Each realm has its own dedicated "
"Admin Console that you can log into with local accounts.  This guide talks "
"more about this in the <<_per_realm_admin_permissions, Dedicated Realm Admin "
"Consoles>> chapter."
