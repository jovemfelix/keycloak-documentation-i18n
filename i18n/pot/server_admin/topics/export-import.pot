"{project_name} has the ability to export and import the entire database.  "
"This can be especially useful if you want to migrate your whole "
"{project_name} database from one environment to another or migrate to a "
"different database (for example from MySQL to Oracle). Export and import is "
"triggered at server boot time and its parameters are passed in via Java "
"system properties.  It is important to note that because import and export "
"happens at server startup, no other actions should be taken on the server or "
"the database while this happens."

"If you have bigger amount of users in your database (500 or more), it's highly recommended to export into directory rather\n"
"      than to single file. Exporting into single file may lead to the very big file. Also the directory provider is using separate transaction for each \"page\" (file with users),\n"
"      which leads to much better performance.\n"
"      Default count of users per file (and transaction) is 50, which showed us best performance, but you have possibility to override (See below).\n"
"      Exporting to single file is using one transaction per whole export and one per whole import, which results in bad performance with large amount of users.\n"
