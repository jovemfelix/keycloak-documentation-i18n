"An application must have authenticated with {project_name} and have received "
"an access token.  This access token will need to have the `broker` client-"
"level role `read-token` set.  This means that the user must have a role "
"mapping for this role and the client application must have that role within "
"its scope.  In this case, given that you are accessing a protected service "
"in {project_name}, you need to send the access token issued by "
"{project_name} during the user authentication.  In the broker configuration "
"page you can automatically assign this role to newly imported users by "
"turning on the `Stored Tokens Readable` switch."
