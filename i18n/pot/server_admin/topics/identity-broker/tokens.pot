"application can use the Google token to use other Google services and REST "

"An application must authenticate with {project_name} and receive an access "
"token. This access token must have the `broker` client-level role `read-"
"token` set, so the user must have a role mapping for this role, and the "
"client application must have that role within its scope. In this case, since "
"you are accessing a protected service in {project_name}, send the access "
"token issued by {project_name} during the user authentication. You can "
"assign this role to newly imported users in the broker configuration page by "
"setting the *Stored Tokens Readable* switch to *ON*."

"These external tokens can be re-established by logging in again through the "
