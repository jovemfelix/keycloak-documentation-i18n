"When using {project_name} as an identity broker, users are not forced to "
"provide their credentials in order to authenticate in a specific realm.  "
"Instead, they are presented with a list of identity providers from which "
"they can authenticate."

"You can also configure a default broker. In this case the user will not be "
"given a choice, but instead be redirected directly to the parent broker."

"The client applications redirects the user to {project_name} to authenticate."

#. type: Plain text

"At this point the user is presented with the login page where there is a "

#. type: Plain text

"User selects one of the identity providers by clicking on its respective "

"{project_name} issues an authentication request to the target identity "
"provider asking for authentication and the user is redirected to the login "
"page of the identity provider.  The connection properties and other "
"configuration options for the identity provider were previously set by the "
"administrator in the Admin Console."

"User provides his credentials or consent in order to authenticate in the "
"identity provider."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Upon a successful authentication by the identity provider, the user is "
"redirected back to {project_name} with an authentication response.  Usually "
"this response contains a security token that will be used by {project_name} "
"to trust the authentication performed by the identity provider and retrieve "
"information about the user."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Now {project_name} is going to check if the response from the identity "
"provider is valid.  If valid, it will import and create a new user or just "
"skip that if the user already exists.  If it is a new user, {project_name} "
"may ask the identity provider for information about the user if that info "
"doesn't already exist in the token.  This is what we call _identity "
"federation_.  If the user already exists {project_name} may ask him to link "
"the identity returned from the identity provider with his existing account.  "
"We call this process _account linking_.  What exactly is done is "
"configurable and can be specified by setup of <<_identity_broker_first_login,"
"First Login Flow>> . At the end of this step, {project_name} authenticates "
"the user and issues its own token in order to access the requested resource "
"in the service provider."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Once the user is locally authenticated, {project_name} redirects the user to "
"the service provider by sending the token previously issued during the local "
"authentication."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The service provider receives the token from {project_name} and allows "
"access to the protected resource."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"There are some variations of this flow that we will talk about later.  For "
"instance, instead of presenting a list of identity providers, the client "
"application can request a specific one.  Or you can tell {project_name} to "
"force the user to provide additional information before federating his "
"identity."

msgid ""
"Different protocols may require different authentication flows.\n"
"      At this moment, all the identity providers supported by {project_name} use a flow just like described above.\n"
"      However, despite the protocol in use, user experience should be pretty much the same.\n"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"As you may notice, at the end of the authentication process {project_name} "
"will always issue its own token to client applications.  What this means is "
"that client applications are completely decoupled from external identity "
"providers.  They don't need to know which protocol (eg.: SAML, OpenID "
"Connect, OAuth, etc) was used or how the user's identity was validated.  "
"They only need to know about {project_name}."
