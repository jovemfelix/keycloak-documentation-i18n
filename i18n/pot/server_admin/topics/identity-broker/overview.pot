"Upon successful authentication by the identity provider, the user redirects "

"{project_name} checks if the response from the identity provider is valid.  "
"If valid, {project_name} imports and creates a user if the user does not "
"already exist. {project_name} may ask the identity provider for further user "
"information if the token does not contain that information. This behavior is "
"_identity federation_.  If the user already exists, {project_name} may ask "
"the user to link the identity returned from the identity provider with the "
"existing account. This behavior is _account linking_. With {project_name}, "
"you can configure _Account linking_ and specify it in the "
