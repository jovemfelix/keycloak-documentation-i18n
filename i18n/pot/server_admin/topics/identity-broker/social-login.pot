"For Internet facing applications, it is quite burdensome for users to have "
"to register at your site to obtain access.  It requires them to remember yet "
"another username and password combination.  Social identity providers allow "
"you to delegate authentication to a semi-trusted and respected entity where "
"the user probably already has an account.  {project_name} provides built-in "
"support for the most common social networks out there, such as Google, "
"Facebook, Twitter, Github, LinkedIn, Microsoft and StackOverflow."
