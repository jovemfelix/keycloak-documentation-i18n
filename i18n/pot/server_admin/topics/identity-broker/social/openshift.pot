"Prior to configuring OpenShift 4 Identity Provider, please locate the correct OpenShift 4 API URL up.\n"
"In some scenarios, that URL might be hidden from users. The easiest way to obtain it is to invoke the following command (this might require installing `jq` command separately) `curl -s -k -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(oc whoami -t)\" \\https://<openshift-user-facing-api-url>/apis/config.openshift.io/v1/infrastructures/cluster | jq \".status.apiServerURL\"`.
