"Default roles allow you to automatically assign user role mappings when any "
"user is newly created or imported through <<_identity_broker, Identity "
"Brokering>>.  To specify default roles go to the `Roles` left menu item, and "
"click the `Default Roles` tab or alternatively you can search for `default-"
"roles-${realmName}` role in the `Realm Roles` tab and then click Edit. "
"Please note the `default-roles-${realmName}` role cannot be removed because "
"it serves as a container for both realm and client default roles."
