"{project_name} has concept of transient sessions. When transient sessions "
"are used, there is no real user session created after successful "
"authentication.  Only a temporary transient session is created for the scope "
"of the current request that successfully authenticated the user. This "
"transient session allows {project_name} to run <<_protocol-mappers, protocol "
"mappers>> after the authentication."

"When transient sessions are used, the client application has no way to "
"refresh or introspect the token or check if a specific session is valid.  In "
"some situations, these actions are not needed, so you can avoid the "
"additional overhead for persistence of user sessions.  This would mean the "
"save of performance, memory and network communication (in case of cluster "
"and cross-datacenter environments)."
