"You can conduct transient sessions in {project_name}. When using transient "
"sessions, {project_name} does not create a user session after successful "
"authentication. {project_name} creates a temporary, transient session for "
"the scope of the current request that successfully authenticates the user. "
"{project_name} can run <<_protocol-mappers, protocol mappers>> using "
"transient sessions after authentication."

"During transient sessions, the client application cannot refresh tokens, "
"introspect tokens, or validate a specific session. Sometimes these actions "
"are unnecessary, so you can avoid the additional resource use of persisting "
"user sessions. This session saves performance, memory, and network "
"communication (in cluster and cross-data center environments) resources."
