"link:http://saml.xml.org/saml-specifications[SAML 2.0] is a similar "
"specification to OIDC but more mature.  It is descended from SOAP and web "
"service messaging specifications so is generally more verbose than OIDC.  "
"SAML 2.0 is an authentication protocol that exchanges XML documents between "
"authentication servers and applications.  XML signatures and encryption are "
"used to verify requests and responses."

"The first use case is an application that requests the {project_name} server "
"authenticates a user.  Upon successful login, the application will receive "
"an XML document. This document contains an SAML assertion that specifies "
"user attributes. The realm digitally signs the the document which contains "
"access information (such as user role mappings) that applications use to "
"determine the resources users are allowed to access in the application."

"The second use case is a client accessing remote services.  The client "
"requests a SAML assertion from {project_name} to invoke on remote services "
"on behalf of the user."
