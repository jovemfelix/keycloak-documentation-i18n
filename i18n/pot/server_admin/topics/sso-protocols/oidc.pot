"link:https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect] (OIDC) is an authentication "

"rfc6749[OAuth 2.0].  While OAuth 2.0 is only a framework for building "
"authorization protocols and is mainly incomplete, OIDC is a full-fledged "
"authentication and authorization protocol.  OIDC also makes heavy use of the "

"about the user such as username, email, and other profile information.  The "
"_access token_ is digitally signed by the realm and contains access "
"information (like user role mappings) that the application can use to "
"determine what resources the user is allowed to access on the application."

"the user.  {project_name} authenticates the user then asks the user for "
"consent to grant access to the client requesting it.  The client then "
"receives the _access token_.  This _access token_ is digitally signed by the "
"realm.  The client can make REST invocations on remote services using this "
"_access token_.  The REST service extracts the _access token_, verifies the "
"signature of the token, then decides based on access information within the "

msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Browser visits application.  The application notices the user is not logged "

#. type: Plain text

"potential replay attacks."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"It is important to note that _access_ tokens are usually short lived and "
"often expired after only minutes.  The additional _refresh_ token that was "
"transmitted by the login protocol allows the application to obtain a new "
"access token after it expires.  This refresh protocol is important in the "
"situation of a compromised system.  If access tokens are short lived, the "
"whole system is only vulnerable to a stolen token for the lifetime of the "
"access token.  Future refresh token requests will fail if an admin has "
"revoked access.  This makes things more secure and more scalable."

"strict about what redirect URIs are registered for the client.  HTML5/"
"JavaScript clients always have to be _public_ clients because there is no "
