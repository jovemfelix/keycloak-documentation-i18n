"link:https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect] (OIDC) is an authentication "
"protocol that is an extension of link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/"
"rfc6749[OAuth 2.0]."

"OAuth 2.0 is a framework for building authorization protocols and is "
"incomplete. OIDC, however, is a full authentication and authorization "
"protocol that uses the link:https://jwt.io[Json Web Token] (JWT) standards.  "
"The JWT standards define an identity token JSON format and methods to "
"digitally sign and encrypt data in a compact and web-friendly way."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"In general, OIDC implements two use cases. The first case is an application "
"requesting that a {project_name} server authenticates a user. Upon "
"successful login, the application receives an _identity token_ and an "
"_access token_.  The _identity token_ contains user information including "
"user name, email, and profile information. The realm digitally signs the "
"_access token_ which contains access information (such as user role "
"mappings) that applications use to determine the resources users can access "
"in the application."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "The second use case is a client accessing remote services."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The client requests an _access token_ from {project_name} to invoke on "
"remote services on behalf of the user."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"{project_name} authenticates the user and asks the user for consent to grant "
"access to the requesting client."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The client receives the _access token_ which is digitally signed by the "
"realm."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The client makes REST requests on remote services using the _access token_."

#. type: Plain text
msgid "The remote REST service extracts the _access token_."

msgid "The remote REST service verifies the tokens signature."

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The remote REST service decides, based on access information within the "
"token, to process or reject the request."
