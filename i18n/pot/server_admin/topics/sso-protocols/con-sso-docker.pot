"Authentication] is a protocol, similar to OIDC, that authenticates users "
"against Docker registries.  {project_name}'s implementation of this protocol "
"lets Docker clients use a {project_name} authentication server authenticate "
"against a registry. This protocol uses standard token and signature "
"mechanisms but it does deviate from a true OIDC implementation. It deviates "
"by using a very specific JSON format for requests and responses as well as "
"mapping repository names and permissions to the OAuth scope mechanism."
