"A user connects to an application using a browser. The application detects "

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The application generates an XML authentication request document and encodes "
"it as a query parameter in a URI. The URI is used to redirect to the "
"{project_name} server. Depending on your settings, the application can also "
"digitally sign the XML document and include the signature as a query "
"parameter in the redirect URI to {project_name}.  This signature is used to "
"validate the client that sends the request."

"After authentication, the server generates an XML authentication response "
"document. The document contains a SAML assertion that holds metadata about "
"the user, including name, address, email, and any role mappings the user "
"has.  The document is usually digitally signed using XML signatures, and may "
"also be encrypted."

msgid "POST binding"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"_POST_ binding is similar to _Redirect_ binding but _POST_ binding exchanges "
"XML documents using POST requests instead of using GET requests. _POST_ "
"Binding uses JavaScript to make the browser send a POST request to the "
"{project_name} server or application when exchanging documents. HTTP "
"responds with an HTML document which contains an HTML form containing "
"embedded JavaScript.  When the page loads, the JavaScript automatically "
"invokes the form."

"Enhanced Client or Proxy (ECP) is a SAML v.2.0 profile which allows the "
