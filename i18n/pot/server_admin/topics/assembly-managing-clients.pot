"Clients are entities that can request authentication of a user.  Clients "
"come in two forms.  The first type of client is an application that wants to "
"participate in single-sign-on.  These clients just want {project_name} to "
"provide security for them.  The other type of client is one that is "
"requesting an access token so that it can invoke other services on behalf of "
"the authenticated user.  This section discusses various aspects around "
"configuring clients and various ways to do it."
