#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Configuration settings on the client can be enforced by client policies "
"during client creation/update, but also during OpenID Connect requests to "
"{project_name} server, which are related to particular client.  "
"{project_name} supports similar thing also through the Client Registration "
"Policies described in the link:{adapterguide_link}"
"#_client_registration_policies[{adapterguide_name}].  However, Client "
"Registration Policies can only cover OIDC Dynamic Client Registration. "
"Client Policies cover not only what Client Registration Policies can do, but "
"other client registration and configuration ways. The current plans are for "
"Client Registration to be replaced by Client Policies."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"{project_name} supports validation whether the client follows settings like "
"Proof Key for Code Exchange, Request Object Signing Algorithm, Holder-of-Key "
"Token, and so on on some endpoints like Authorization Endpoint, Token "
"Endpoint, and so on.  These can be specified by each setting item (on Admin "
"Console, switch, pulldown menu and so on). To make the client application "
"secure, the administrator needs to set many settings in the appropriate way, "
"which makes it difficult for the administrator to secure the client "
"application.  Client Policies can do these validation of client "
"configurations mentioned just above and they can also be used to auto-"
"configure some client configuration switches to meet the advanced security "
"requirements. In the future, individual client configuration settings may be "
"replaced by Client Policies directly performing required validations."

"A condition determines to which client a policy is adopted and when it is "

"checks whether one specified criteria is satisfied. For example, some "
"condition checks whether the access type of the client is confidential."
