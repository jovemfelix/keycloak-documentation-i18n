"{project_name} is a single sign on solution for web apps and RESTful web "
"services.  The goal of {project_name} is to make security simple so that it "
"is easy for application developers to secure the apps and services they have "
"deployed in their organization.  Security features that developers normally "
"have to write for themselves are provided out of the box and are easily "
"tailorable to the individual requirements of your organization.  "
"{project_name} provides customizable user interfaces for login, "
"registration, administration, and account management.  You can also use "
"{project_name} as an integration platform to hook it into existing LDAP and "
"Active Directory servers.  You can also delegate authentication to third "
"party identity providers like Facebook and Google."
