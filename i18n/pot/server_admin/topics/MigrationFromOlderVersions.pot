"This chapter contains some general migration details which are applicable to "

msgid "Migration of config files using migration scripts"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"As part of your migration, you should use your old versions of config files "
"`standalone.xml`, `standalone-ha.xml`, and/or `domain.xml`.  These files "
"typically contain configuration that is unique to your own environment.  So, "
"the first thing to do as part of a migration is to copy those files to the "
"new Keycloak server installation, replacing the default versions."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"If migrating from Keycloak version 2.1.0 or older, you should also copy "
"`keycloak-server.json` to `standalone/configuration` and/or `domain/"
"configuration`."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"There will be configuration in those config files that pertains to Keycloak, "
"which will need to be upgraded.  For that, you should run one or more of the "
"appropriate upgrade scripts.  They are `migrate-standalone.cli`, `migrate-"
"standalone-ha.cli`, `migrate-domain-standalone.cli` and `migrate-domain-"
"clustered.cli`."

"Note that for upgrading domain.xml, there are two migration scripts, "
"`migrate-domain-standalone.cli` and `migrate-domain-clustered.cli`.  These "
"scripts migrate separate profiles within your domain.xml that were "
"originally shipped with Keycloak.  If you have changed the name of the "
"profile there is a variable near the top of the script that you will need to "
"change."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"If you are migrating `keycloak-server.json`, this will also be migrated as "
"needed.  If you prefer, you can migrate `keycloak-server.json` beforehand "
"using the instructions in the next section."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"One thing to note is that the migration scripts only work for Keycloak "
"versions 1.8.1 forward.  If migrating an older version you will need to "
"manually upgrade your config files to at least be 1.8.1 compliant."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"Lastly, you may want to examine the contents of the scripts before running.  "

"Keycloak is moving away from the use of keycloak-server.json.  For this "
"release, the server will still work if this file is in `standalone/"

"convert to using standalone.xml, standalone-ha.xml, or domain.xml for "
"configuration. We may soon remove support for keycloak-server.json."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"To convert your keycloak-server.json, you will use a jboss-cli operation "

"the server is not running."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The `migrate-json` operation assumes you are migrating with an xml "
"configuration file from an old version.  For example, you should not try to "
"migrate your keycloak-server.json to a standalone.xml file that already "
"contains <spi> and <theme> tags under the keycloak subsystem.  Before "
"migration, your keycloak subsystem should look like the one below:"
