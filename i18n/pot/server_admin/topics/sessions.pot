"When a user logs into a realm, {project_name} maintains a user session for "
"them and remembers each and every client they have visited within the "
"session.  There are a lot of administrative functions that realm admins can "
"perform on these user sessions.  They can view login stats for the entire "
"realm and dive down into each client to see who is logged in and where.  "
"Admins can logout a user or a set of users from the Admin Console. They can "
"revoke tokens and set up all the token and session timeouts there too."
