"With Time-Based One Time Passwords (TOTP), the token generator will hash the "
"current time and a shared secret.  The server validates the OTP by comparing "
"the hashes within a window of time to the submitted value.  TOTPs are valid "
"for a short window of time."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"With Counter-Based One Time Passwords (HOTP), {project_name} uses a shared "
"counter rather than the current time. The {project_name} server increments "
"the counter with each successful OTP login. Valid OTPs change after a "
"successful login."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"TOTP is more secure than HOTP because the matchable OTP is valid for a short "
"window of time, while the OTP for HOTP is valid for an indeterminate amount "
"of time. HOTP is more user-friendly than TOTP because no time limit exists "
"to enter the OTP."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"HOTP requires a database update every time the server increments the "
"counter. This update is a performance drain on the authentication server "
"during heavy load. To increase efficiency, TOTP does not remember passwords "
"used, so there is no need to perform database updates. The drawback is that "
"it is possible to re-use TOTPs in the valid time interval."
