"Each new realm created has no password policies associated with it.  Users "
"can have as short, as long, as complex, as insecure a password, as they "
"want.  Simple settings are fine for development or learning {project_name}, "
"but unacceptable in production environments.  {project_name} has a rich set "
"of password policies you can enable through the Admin Console."

"Passwords are not stored as clear text. Instead they are hashed using "
"standard hashing algorithms before they are stored or validated.  The only "
"built-in and default algorithm available is PBKDF2. See the link:"
"{developerguide_link}[{developerguide_name}] on how to plug in your own "
"algorithm. Note that if you do change the algorithm, password hashes will "
"not change in storage until the next time the user logs in."

msgid ""
"This value specifies the number of times a password will be hashed before it "
"is stored or verified. The default value is 27,500.  This hashing is done in "
"the rare case that a hacker gets access to your password database. Once they "
"have access to the database, they can reverse engineer user passwords.  The "
"industry recommended value for this parameter changes every year as CPU "
"power improves. A higher hashing iteration value takes more CPU power for "
"hashing, and can impact performance. You'll have to weigh what is more "
"important to you: performance or protecting your passwords stores.  There "
"may be more cost effective ways of protecting your password stores."

"blacklists are UTF-8 plain-text files with Unix line endings where every "
"line represents a blacklisted password.  All passwords in the blacklist must "
"be lowercased to facilitate case-insensitive comparison.  The file name of "
"the blacklist file must be provided as the password policy value, e.g. "
"`10_million_password_list_top_1000000.txt`.  Blacklist files are resolved "
"against `${jboss.server.data.dir}/password-blacklists/` by default.  This "
"path can be customized via the `keycloak.password.blacklists.path` system "
"property, or the `blacklistsPath` property of the `passwordBlacklist` policy "
"SPI configuration."
