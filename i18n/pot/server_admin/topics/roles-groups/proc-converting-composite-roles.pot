"Any realm or client level role can become a _composite role_. A _composite "
"role_ is a role that has one or more additional roles associated with it. "
"When a composite role is mapped to a user, the user gains the roles "
"associated with the composite role.  This inheritance is recursive so users "
"also inherit any composite of composites. However, we recommend that "
"composite roles are not overused."
