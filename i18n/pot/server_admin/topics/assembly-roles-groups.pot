"Roles and groups have a similar purpose, which is to give users access and "
"permissions to use applications. Groups are a collection of users to which "
"you apply roles and attributes. Roles define specific applications "
"permissions and access control."

"A role typically applies to one type of user. For example, an organization "
"may include `admin`, `user`, `manager`, and `employee` roles. An application "
"can assign access and permissions to a role and then assign multiple users "
"to that role so the users have the same access and permissions. For example, "
"the Admin Console has roles that give permission to users to access "
"different parts of the Admin Console."
