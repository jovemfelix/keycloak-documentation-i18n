"There are a few features you should be aware of when configuring "
"authentication for your realm.  Many organizations have strict password and "
"OTP policies that you can enforce via settings in the Admin Console.  You "
"may or may not want to require different credential types for "
"authentication.  You may want to give users the option to login via Kerberos "
"or disable or enable various built-in credential types.  This chapter covers "
"all of these topics."
