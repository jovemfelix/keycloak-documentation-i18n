"When you boot {project_name} for the first time {project_name} creates a pre-"
"defined realm for you. This initial realm is the _master_ realm. It is the "
"highest level in the hierarchy of realms. Admin accounts in this realm have "
"permissions to view and manage any other realm created on the server "
"instance.  When you define your initial admin account, you create an account "
"in the _master_ realm. Your initial login to the admin console will also be "
"via the _master_ realm."

"We recommend that you do not use the _master_ realm to manage the users and "
"applications in your organization. Reserve use of the _master_ realm for "
"_super_ admins to create and manage the realms in your system. Following "
"this security model helps prevent accidental changes and follows the "
"tradition of permitting user accounts access to only those privileges and "
"powers necessary for the successful completion of their current task."

"It is possible to disable the _master_ realm and define admin accounts "
"within each individual new realm you create. Each realm has its own "
"dedicated Admin Console that you can log into with local accounts. This "
"guide talks more about this in the <<_per_realm_admin_permissions, Dedicated "
"Realm Admin Consoles>> chapter."
