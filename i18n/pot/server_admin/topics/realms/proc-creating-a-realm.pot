"You create a realm to provide a management space where you can create users "
"and give them permissions to use applications. At first login, you are "

"When deciding what realms you need, consider the kind of isolation you want "
"to have for your users and applications.  For example, you might create a "
"realm for the employees of your company and a separate realm for your "
"customers.  Your employees would log into the employee realm and only be "
"able to visit internal company applications.  Customers would log into the "
"customer realm and only be able to interact with customer-facing apps."
