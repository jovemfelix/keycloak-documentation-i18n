"By default, each new client application has an unlimited `role scope "
"mappings`.  This means that every access token that is created for that "
"client will contain all the permissions the user has.  If the client gets "
"compromised and the access token is leaked, then each system that the user "
"has permission to access is now also compromised.  It is highly suggested "
"that you limit the roles an access token is assigned by using the "
"<<_role_scope_mappings, Scope menu>> for each client.  Or alternatively, you "
"can set role scope mappings at the Client Scope level and assign Client "
"Scopes to your client by using the <<_client_scopes_linking, Client Scope "
"menu>>."
