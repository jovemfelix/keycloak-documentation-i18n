"By default, each new client application has an unlimited scope.  This means "
"that every access token that is created for that client will contain all the "
"permissions the user has.  If the client gets compromised and the access "
"token is leaked, then each system that the user has permission to access is "
"now also compromised.  It is highly suggested that you limit the roles an "
"access token is assigned by using the <<_client_scope, Scope menu>> for each "
"client."
