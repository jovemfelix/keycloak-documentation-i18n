"Typical users who are stored in {project_name} have various attributes "
"related to their user profiles. Such attributes include email, firstName or "
"lastname.  However users may also have attributes, which are not typical "
"profile data, but rather metadata. The metadata attributes usually should be "
"read-only for the users and the typical users never should have a way to "
"update those attributes from the {project_name} user interface or Account "
"REST API. Some of the attributes should be even read-only for the "
"administrators when creating or updating user with the Admin REST API."

"Various links or metadata related to the user storage providers. For example "
"in case of the LDAP integration, the `LDAP_ID` attribute contains the ID of "
"the user in the LDAP server."

#. type: Plain text

"Metadata provisioned by User Storage. For example `createdTimestamp` "
"provisioned from the LDAP should be always read-only by user or "
"administrator."

#. type: Plain text

"Metadata related to various authenticators. For example `KERBEROS_PRINCIPAL` "
"attribute can contain the kerberos principal name of the particular user. "
"Similarly attribute `usercertificate` can contain metadata related to "
"binding the user with the data from the X.509 certificate, which is used "
"typically when X.509 certificate authentication is enabled."

#. type: Plain text

"Metadata related to the identificator of users by the applications/clients. "
"For example `saml.persistent.name.id.for.my_app` can contain SAML NameID, "
"which will be used by the client application `my_app` as the identifier of "
"the user."

#. type: Plain text

"Metadata related to the authorization policies, which are used for the "
"attribute based access control (ABAC). Values of those attributes may be "
"used for the authorization decisions. Hence it is important that those "
"attributes cannot be updated by the users."

"From the long term perspective, {project_name} will have a proper User "
"Profile SPI, which will allow fine-grained configuration of every user "
"attribute. Currently this capability is not fully available yet. So "
"{project_name} has the internal list of user attributes, which are read-only "
"for the users and read-only for the administrators configured at the server "
"level."

"This is the list of the read-only attributes, which are used internally by "

"For this example, users and administrators would not be able to update "
"attribute `foo`. Users would not be able to edit any attributes starting "
"with the `bar`.  So for example `bar` or `barrier`. Configuration is case "
"insensitive, so attributes like `FOO` or `BarRier` will be denied as well "
"for this example. The wildcard character `\\*` is supported only at the end "
"of the attribute name, so the administrator can effectively deny all the "
"attributes starting with the specified character. The `*` in the middle of "
"the attribute is considered as a normal character."
