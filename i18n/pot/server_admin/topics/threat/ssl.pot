"OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect uses access tokens for security. Attackers can scan "
"your network for access tokens and use them to perform malicious operations "
"for which the token has permission. This attack is known as a man-in-the-"
"middle attack. Use SSL/HTTPS for communication between the {project_name} "
"auth server and the clients {project_name} secures to prevent man-in-the-"
"middle attacks."

"{project_name} has <<_ssl_modes,three modes for SSL/HTTPS>>. SSL is complex "
"to set up, so {project_name} allows non-HTTPS communication over private IP "
"addresses such as localhost, 192.168.x.x, and other private IP addresses. In "
"production, ensure you enable SSL and SSL is compulsory for all operations."

"On the adapter/client-side, you can disable the SSL trust manager. The trust "
"manager ensures the client's identity that {project_name} communicates with "
"is valid and ensures the DNS domain name against the server's certificate. "
"In production, ensure that each of your client adapters uses a truststore to "
"prevent DNS man-in-the-middle attacks."
