"Clickjacking is a technique of tricking users into clicking on a user "
"interface element different from what users perceive. A malicious site loads "
"the target site in a transparent iFrame, overlaid on top of a set of dummy "
"buttons placed directly under important buttons on the target site. When a "
"user clicks a visible button, they are clicking a button on the hidden page. "
"An attacker can steal a user's authentication credentials and access their "
"resources by using this method."

"By default, every response by {project_name} sets some specific browser "

"TR/CSP/[Content-Security-Policy].  You should take a look at the definition "
"of both of these headers as there is a lot of fine-grain browser access you "
"can control."
