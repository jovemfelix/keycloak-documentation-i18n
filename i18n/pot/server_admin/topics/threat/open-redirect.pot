"An attacker could use the end-user authorization endpoint and the redirect "
"URI parameter to abuse the authorization server as an open redirector.  An "
"open redirector is an endpoint using a parameter to automatically redirect a "
"user agent to the location specified by the parameter value without any "
"validation.  An attacker could utilize a user's trust in an authorization "
"server to launch a phishing attack."

"{project_name} requires that all registered applications and clients "
"register at least one redirection URI pattern.  Any time a client asks "
"{project_name} to perform a redirect (on login or logout for example), "
"{project_name} will check the redirect URI vs.  the list of valid registered "
"URI patterns.  It is important that clients and applications register as "
"specific a URI pattern as possible to mitigate open redirector attacks."
