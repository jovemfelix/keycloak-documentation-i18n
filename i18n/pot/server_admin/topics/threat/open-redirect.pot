"An open redirector is an endpoint using a parameter to automatically "
"redirect a user agent to the location specified by the parameter value "
"without validation. An attacker can use the end-user authorization endpoint "
"and the redirect URI parameter to use the authorization server as an open "
"redirector, using a user's trust in an authorization server to launch a "
"phishing attack."

"{project_name} requires that all registered applications and clients "
"register at least one redirection URI pattern. When a client requests that "
"{project_name} performs a redirect, {project_name} checks the redirect URI "
"against the list of valid registered URI patterns. Clients and applications "
"must register as specific a URI pattern as possible to mitigate open "
"redirector attacks."
