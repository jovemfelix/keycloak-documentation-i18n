"For the <<_oidc-auth-flows,Authorization Code Flow>>, if you register "
"redirect URIs that are too general, then it would be possible for a rogue "
"client to impersonate a different client that has a broader scope of "
"access.  This could happen for instance if two clients live under the same "
"domain.  So, it's a good idea to make your registered redirect URIs as "
"specific as feasible."
