#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The Signature SPI makes it possible to plug-in additional signature "
"algorithms. This enables additional signatures and also enables changing how "
"signatures are generated. For example, using this allows using an HSM device "
"to sign tokens."

"Alongside the Signature SPI there is now also support for additional "
"signature algorithms."

"Keycloak now has support for RS256, RS384, RS512, ES256, ES384, ES512, "
"HS256, HS384 and HS512."

"Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ES256/384/512) are very "
"interesting as they provide similar security properties as RSA signatures, "
"but use significantly less CPU."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"HMAC (HS256/384/512) are also very useful when you do not want your "
"application to verify the signature itself.  Since these are symmetric "
"signatures only Keycloak is able to verify the signature, which requires the "
"application to use the token introspection endpoint to verify tokens."

"It is now possible to specify the audiences in the tokens issued for OpenID "
"Connect clients. There is also support for verification of audience on the "
