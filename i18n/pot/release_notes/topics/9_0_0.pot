"In this release, we did some usability improvements to the authentication "
"flows. It should be easier for the end user to choose between available "
"authentication mechanisms for two-factor authentication. It should be more "
"intuitive to log in with OTP or WebAuthn considering the fact that user can "
"have more OTP or WebAuthn credentials. There is also better support for "
"passwordless WebAuthn authentication.  Finally, we did some work on defects "
"related to the authentication flows."
