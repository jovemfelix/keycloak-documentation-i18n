"We now have a partial implementation of the specification https://tools.ietf."
"org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-mtls-08[OAuth 2.0 Mutual TLS Client Authentication "
"and Certificate Bound Access Tokens] .  More accurately we have support for "
"the Certificate Bound Access Tokens. If your confidential client is able to "
"use 2-way SSL, {project_name} will be able to add the hash of the client "
"certificate into the tokens issued for the client. At this moment, it's just "
"the {project_name} itself, which verifies the token hashes (for example "
"during `refresh token` requests).  We plan to add support to adapters as "
"well. We also plan to add support for Mutual TLS Client Authentication."
