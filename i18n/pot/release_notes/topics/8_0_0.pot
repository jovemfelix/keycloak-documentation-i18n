"Message bundles in theme resources enables internationalization of custom "
"providers such as authenticators. They are also shared between all theme "
"types, making it possible to for example share messages between the login "

msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"We have added a new SPI that allows for the configuration of custom role "
"mappers that are used by the SAML adapters to map the roles extracted from "
"the SAML assertion into roles that exist in the SP application environment. "
"This is particularly useful when the adapters need to communicate with third "
"party IDPs and the roles set by the IDP in the assertion do not correspond "
"to the roles that were defined for the SP application. The provider to be "
"used can configured in the `keycloak-saml.xml` file or in the `keycloak-"
"saml` subsystem. An implementation that performs the role mappings based on "
"the contents of a properties file was also provided."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Notice that when {project_name} acts as the IDP we can use the built-in role "
"mappers to perform any necessary mappings before setting the roles into the "
"assertion, so this SPI will probably be redundant in this case. The "
"`RoleMappingsProvider` SPI was designed for situations when the IDP offer no "
"way to map roles before adding them to the assertion."
