"Red Hat is proud to announce the release of version 7.3 of Red Hat Single "
"Sign-On (RH-SSO). RH-SSO is based on the Keycloak project, and enables you "
"to secure your web applications by providing Web SSO capabilities based on "
"popular standards such as OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML 2.0. The RH-"
"SSO server acts as an OpenID Connect or SAML-based identity provider (IdP), "
"allowing your enterprise user directory or third-party IdP to secure your "
"applications via standards-based security tokens."

#. type: Plain text

"Some of the new features in this release are technology preview features, "
"which means they are available, but not fully supported. You may use these "
"for testing, but features marked for technology preview are not supported "
"for use in production. These are marked as technology preview in this list "
"and in our documentation. Because they are not fully supported for "
"production use, technology preview features are disabled by default, but the "
"features can be enabled if you want to try them out. We are seeking feedback "
"on the technology preview features, so please log a support ticket if you "
"have comments on a technology preview feature. Once a feature transitions "
"from technology preview to production supported, the API and functionality "
"are fixed for the lifecyle of the major version, so comments during the tech "
"preview period are critical to influencing a feature in the way you want."

"Authorization Services was introduced as a technology preview feature in the "
"RH-SSO 7.1 release. In 7.3 it is now fully supported, except for a small "
"subcomponent related to custom rules implemented using Drools, which remains "
"tech preview."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Authorization Services has been upgraded to be based on the new User Managed "
"Access 2.0 (UMA 2.0) specification. Previous releases relied on the UMA 1.0 "
"version. Upgrading introduced the ability for users to manage their "
"resources, associated permissions, approve requests to access and share them "
"with other users through the account management console."

"Asynchronous authorization flow - Client applications can now choose whether "

"on behalf of another user."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"User-managed Permission API - Resource servers are now capable of "
"associating additional policies to resources owned by a particular user. The "
"new API provides operations to manage these permissions using different "
"policy types such as role, group, user, client, or a condition using "
"JavaScript."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Pushed claims - Client applications are now able to send arbitrary claims to "
"Keycloak along with an authorization request in order to evaluate "
"permissions based on these claims. This is a very handy addition when access "
"should be granted (or denied) in the scope of a specific transaction or "
"based on information about the runtime."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Policy enforcer - The policy enforcer now accepts regular access tokens, "
"longer requiring to exchange access tokens with RPTs in order to access "
"resources protected by a resource server (when not using UMA). Depending on "
"how the policy enforcer is configured on the resource server side, regular "
"access tokens as a bearer token can be leveraged."
