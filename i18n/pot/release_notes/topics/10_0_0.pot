"A new SPI was introduced to allow better flexibility when setting security "
"related headers on responses. This provides a cleaner implementation within "
"Keycloak, but also allows full customisation if needed. Security headers are "
"now set by a response filter instead of within the code itself, which makes "
"it less error prone, removing the chance that some response are missing "
"headers."
