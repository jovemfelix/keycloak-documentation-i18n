"Without comparison the biggest highlight of this release is all the "

"The CLI has been polished to hell and back, and we believe it now provides a "
"very simple and convenient approach to configuring and running Keycloak. "
"It's almost so simple that documentation shouldn't be needed."

"That doesn't mean we don't plan to provide documentation for configuring "

"We are rapidly moving towards making the Quarkus distribution our default "

"provide us with feedback if you find any usability issues, are not able to "
"configure something with it, or if you discover any bugs."
