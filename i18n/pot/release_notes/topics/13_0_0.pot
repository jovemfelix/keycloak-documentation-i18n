"Default roles are now internally stored as composite roles of a new role "
"usually named `default-roles-<realmName>`. Instead of assigning both realm "
"and all client default roles directly to newly created users or users "
"imported through Identity Brokering, just the role is assigned to them and "
"the rest of default roles are assigned as effective roles. This change "
"improves performance of default roles processing, especially with larger "
"number of clients, because it is no longer necessary to go through all "
"clients."
