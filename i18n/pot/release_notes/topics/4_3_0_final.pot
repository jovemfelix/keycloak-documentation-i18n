"The hostname SPI introduces a more flexible way to configure the hostname "
"for {project_name}. There are two built-in providers. The first is request, "
"which uses the request headers to determine the hostname. The second is "
"fixed, which allows configuring a fixed hostname. The latter makes sure that "
"only valid hostnames can be used and also allows internal applications to "
"invoke {project_name} through an alternative URL."

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"For this release, we improved policy evaluation performance across the "
"board, increasing reliability and throughput. The main changes we did were "
"related with trying to optimize the policy evaluation path by avoiding "
"unnecessary flows and collect decisions as soon as they happen. We also "
"introduced a policy decision cache on a per request basis, avoiding "
"redundant decisions from policies previously evaluated."

#. type: Plain text

"We are also working on other layers of cache which should give a much better "
"experience. See https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-7952[KEYCLOAK-7952]."

"unsafe elements like `<script>`."
