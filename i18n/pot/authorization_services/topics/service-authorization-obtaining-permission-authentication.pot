"This method is especially useful when the client is acting on behalf of a "
"user.  In this case, the bearer token is an access token previously issued "
"by {project_name} to some client acting on behalf of a user (or on behalf of "
"itself). Permissions will be evaluated considering the access context "
"represented by the access token.  For instance, if the access token was "
"issued to Client A acting on behalf of User A, permissions will be granted "
"depending on the resources and scopes to which User A has access."
