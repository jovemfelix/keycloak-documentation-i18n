"`Required`. When you do that, the policy will grant access only if the user "
"requesting access has been granted *all* the *required* roles. Both realm "
"and client roles can be configured as such."

"Required roles can be useful when your policy defines multiple roles but "
"only a subset of them are mandatory. In this case, you can combine realm and "
"client roles to enable an even more fine-grained role-based access control "
"(RBAC) model for your application. For example, you can have policies "
"specific for a client and require a specific client role associated with "
"that client. Or you can enforce that access is granted only in the presence "
"of a specific realm role. You can also combine both approaches within the "
"same policy."
