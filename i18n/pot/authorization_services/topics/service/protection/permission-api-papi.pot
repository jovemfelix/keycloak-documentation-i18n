"_Permission ticket support is limited_.  In the full UMA protocol, resource "
"servers can register permission requests in the server to support "
"authorization flows where a resource owner (the user that owns a resource "
"being requested) can approve access to his resources by third parties, among "
"other ways. This represents one of the main features of the UMA "
"specification: resource owners can control their own resources and the "
"policies that govern them. Currently {project_name} UMA implementation "
"support is very limited in this regard. For example, the system does not "
"store permission tickets on the server and we are essentially using UMA to "
"provide API security and base our authorization offerings. In the future, "
"full support of UMA and other use cases is planned."
