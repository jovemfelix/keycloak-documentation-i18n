"When cluster nodes are isolated on a private network it requires access to "
"the private network to be able to join a cluster or to view communication in "
"the cluster. In addition you can also enable authentication and encryption "
"for cluster communication. As long as your private network is secure it is "
"not necessary to enable authentication and encryption. {project_name} does "
"not send very sensitive information on the cluster in either case."
