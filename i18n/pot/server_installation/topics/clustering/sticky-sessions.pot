"Typical cluster deployment consists of the load balancer (reverse proxy) and "
"2 or more {project_name} servers on private network. For performance "
"purposes, it may be useful if load balancer forwards all requests related to "
"particular browser session to the same {project_name} backend node."

"The reason is, that {project_name} is using infinispan distributed cache "
"under the covers for save data related to current authentication session and "
"user session.  The Infinispan distributed caches are configured with one "
"owner by default. That means that particular session is saved just on one "
"cluster node and the other nodes need to lookup the session remotely if they "
"want to access it."

"For example if authentication session with ID `123` is saved in the "

"Some loadbalancers can be configured to add the route information by "

"adding the route by the {project_name} is more clever as {project_name} "
"knows, who is the owner of particular session entity and can route it to "
"that node, which is not necessarily the local node.  We plan to support the "
"setup where the route info won't be added to AUTH_SESSION_ID cookie by the "
"{project_name} server, but instead by the load balancer. However adding the "
"cookie by {project_name} would be still the preferred option."
