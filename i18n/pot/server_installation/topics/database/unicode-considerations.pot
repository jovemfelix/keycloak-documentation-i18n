"Otherwise, characters are limited to those contained in database encoding "
"which is often 8-bit. However, for some database systems, it is possible to "
"enable UTF-8 encoding of Unicode characters and use full Unicode character "
"set in all text fields. Often, this is counterbalanced by shorter maximum "
"length of the strings than in case of 8-bit encodings."

"Some of the databases require special settings to database and/or JDBC "
"driver to be able to handle Unicode characters.  Please find the settings "
"for your database below. Note that if a database is listed here, it can "
"still work properly provided it handles UTF-8 encoding properly both on the "
"level of database and JDBC driver."

"Technically, the key criterion for Unicode support for all fields is whether "
"the database allows setting of Unicode character set for `VARCHAR` and "
"`CHAR` fields. If yes, there is a high chance that Unicode will be "
"plausible, usually at the expense of field length. If it only supports "
"Unicode in `NVARCHAR` and `NCHAR` fields, Unicode support for all text "
"fields is unlikely as Keycloak schema uses `VARCHAR` and `CHAR` fields "
"extensively."

"Unicode characters are properly handled provided the database was created "

"If the database character set is not Unicode, then to use Unicode characters "
"in the special fields, the JDBC driver needs to be configured with the "
"connection property `oracle.jdbc.defaultNChar` set to `true`. It might be "
"wise, though not strictly necessary, to also set the `oracle.jdbc."
"convertNcharLiterals` connection property to `true`. These properties can be "
"set either as system properties or as connection properties. Please note "
"that setting `oracle.jdbc.defaultNChar` may have negative impact on "
"performance. For details, please refer to Oracle JDBC driver configuration "
"documentation."

"not work due to different storage requirements to `utf8` character set "
"footnote:[Tracked as https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-3873]). Note "
"that in this case, length restriction to non-special fields does not apply "
"because columns are created to accommodate given amount of characters, not "
