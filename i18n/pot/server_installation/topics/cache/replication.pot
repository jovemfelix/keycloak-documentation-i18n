"There are caches like `sessions`, `authenticationSessions`, "
"`offlineSessions`, `loginFailures` and a few others (See <<_eviction>> for "
"more details), which are configured as distributed caches when using a "
"clustered setup. Entries are not replicated to every single node, but "
"instead one or more nodes is chosen as an owner of that data.  If a node is "
"not the owner of a specific cache entry it queries the cluster to obtain "
"it.  What this means for failover is that if all the nodes that own a piece "
"of data go down, that data is lost forever.  By default, {project_name} only "
"specifies one owner for data.  So if that one node goes down that data is "
"lost.  This usually means that users will be logged out and will have to "
"login again."

"It is generally wise to configure your environment to use loadbalancer with sticky sessions. It is beneficial for performance\n"
"     as {project_name} server, where the particular request is served, will be usually the owner of the data from the distributed cache\n"
"     and will therefore be able to look up the data locally. See <<sticky-sessions>> for more details.\n"
