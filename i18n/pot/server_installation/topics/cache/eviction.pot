"There are multiple different caches configured for {project_name}.  There is "
"a realm cache that holds information about secured applications, general "
"security data, and configuration options.  There is also a user cache that "
"contains user metadata.  Both caches default to a maximum of 10000 entries "
"and use a least recently used eviction strategy.  Each of them is also tied "
"to an object revisions cache that controls eviction in a clustered setup.  "
"This cache is created implicitly and has twice the configured size. The same "
"applies for the `authorization` cache, which holds the authorization data. "
"The `keys` cache holds data about external keys and does not need to have "
"dedicated revisions cache. Rather it has `expiration` explicitly declared on "
"it, so the keys are periodically expired and forced to be periodically "
"downloaded from external clients or identity providers."

"The eviction policy and max entries for these caches can be configured in "
"the _standalone.xml_, _standalone-ha.xml_, or _domain.xml_ depending on your "
"<<_operating-mode, operating mode>>. In the configuration file, there is the "
"part with infinispan subsystem, which looks similar to this:"
