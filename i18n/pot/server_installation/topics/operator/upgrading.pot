"You can configure how the operator performs {project_name} upgrades. You can "
"choose from the following upgrade strategies."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"`recreate`: This is the default strategy. The operator removes all "
"{project_name} replicas, optionally creates a backup and then creates the "
"replicas based on a newer {project_name} image. This strategy is suitable "
"for major upgrades as a single {project_name} version is accessing the "
"underlying database. The downside is {project_name} needs to be shut down "
"during the upgrade."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"`rolling`: The operator removes one replica at a time and creates it again "
"based on a newer {project_name} image. This ensures a zero-downtime upgrade "
"but is more suitable for minor version upgrades that do not require database "
"migration since the database is accessed by multiple {project_name} versions "
"concurrently. Automatic backups are not supported with this strategy."
