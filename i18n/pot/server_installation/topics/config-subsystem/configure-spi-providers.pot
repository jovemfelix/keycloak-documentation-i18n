"{project_name} is a highly modular system that allows great flexibility.  "
"There are more than 50 service provider interfaces (SPIs), and you are "
"allowed to swap out implementations of each SPI.  An implementation of an "
"SPI is known as a _provider_."

"Here we have two providers defined for the SPI `myspi`.  The `default-"
"provider` is listed as `myprovider`.  However it is up to the SPI to decide "
"how it will treat this setting.  Some SPIs allow more than one provider and "
"some do not.  So `default-provider` can help the SPI to choose."

"Also notice that each provider defines its own set of configuration "
"properties.  The fact that both providers above have a property called `foo` "

"We see that the value begins and ends with square brackets.  That means that "
"the value will be passed to the provider as a list.  In this example, the "
"system will pass the provider a list with two element values _EVENT1_ and "
"_EVENT2_. To add more values to the list, just separate each list element "
"with a comma. Unfortunately, you do need to escape the quotes surrounding "
"each list element with `\\&quot;`."
