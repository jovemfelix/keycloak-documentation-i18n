"After you create custom resources for realms, clients, and users, you can "
"manage them by using the {project_name} admin console or as custom resources "
"using the `{create_cmd_brief}` command.  However, you cannot use both "
"methods, because the Operator performs a one way sync for custom resources "
"that you modify.  For example, if you modify a realm custom resource, the "
"changes show up in the admin console. However, if you modify the realm using "
"the admin console, those changes have no effect on the custom resource."
