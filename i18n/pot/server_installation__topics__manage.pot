"In the upcoming chapters, you'll often be provided two options for applying "
"application server configuration changes to your deployment.  You'll be "
"shown how to edit the _standalone.xml_ or _domain.xml_ directly.  This must "
"be done when the server (or servers) are offline.  Additionally, you may be "
"shown how to apply config changes on a running server using the app server's "
"command line interface ({appserver_name} CLI).  This chapter discusses how "
