"A realm manages a set of users, credentials, roles, and groups.  A user belongs to and logs into a realm.  Realms are isolated from one another\n"
"and can only manage and authenticate the users that they control.  One {project_name} deployment can define, store, and manage as many realms\n"
"as there is space for in the database.  When deciding whether to have one or more realms think about what kind of isolation you want to have for\n"
"your users and applications.  For example, you might define a realm for the employees of your company and have a separate realm for your customers.\n"
"You employees would log into the employee realm and only be able to visit internal company applications.  Customers would log into the customer\n"
"realm and only be able to interact with customer-facing apps.  In this section you'll learn some basics about realm creation and configuration.\n"
