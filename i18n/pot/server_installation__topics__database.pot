"{project_name} comes with its own embedded Java-based relational database "
"called H2.  This is the default database that {project_name} will use to "
"persist data and really only exists so that you can run the authentication "
"server out of the box.  We highly recommend that you replace it with a more "
"production ready external database.  The H2 database is not very viable in "
"high concurrency situations and should not be used in a cluster either.  The "
"purpose of this chapter is to show you how to connect {project_name} to a "
"more mature database."

"{project_name} uses two layered technologies to persist its relational "
"data.  The bottom layered technology is JDBC.  JDBC is a Java API that is "
"used to connect to a RDBMS.  There are different JDBC drivers per database "
"type that are provided by your database vendor.  This chapter discusses how "
"to configure {project_name} to use one of these vendor-specific drivers."

"The top layered technology for persistence is Hibernate JPA.  This is a "
"object to relational mapping API that maps Java Objects to relational data.  "
"Most deployments of {project_name} will never have to touch the "
"configuration aspects of Hibernate, but we will discuss how that is done if "
"you run into that rare circumstance."
