"You can log out of a web application in multiple ways.  For Java EE servlet "
"containers, you can call `HttpServletRequest.logout()`. For other browser "
"applications, you can redirect the browser to `$$http://auth-server/auth/"
"realms/{realm-name}/protocol/openid-connect/logout?"
"redirect_uri=encodedRedirectUri$$`, which logs you out if you have an SSO "
"session with your browser."

"When using the `HttpServletRequest.logout()` option the adapter executes a "
"back-channel POST call against the {project_name} server passing the refresh "
"token.  If the method is executed from an unprotected page (a page that does "
"not check for a valid token) the refresh token can be unavailable and, in "
"that case, the adapter skips the call. For this reason, using a protected "
"page to execute `HttpServletRequest.logout()` is recommended so that current "
"tokens are always taken into account and an interaction with the "
"{project_name} server is performed if needed."

"If you want to avoid logging out of an external identity provider as part of "
"the logout process, you can supply the parameter `$$initiating_idp$$`, with "
"the value being the identity (alias) of the identity provider in question. "
"This is useful when the logout endpoint is invoked as part of single logout "
"initiated by the external identity provider."
