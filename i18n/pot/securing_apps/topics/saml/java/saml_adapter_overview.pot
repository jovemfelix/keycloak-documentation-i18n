"This document describes the Keycloak SAML client adapter and how it can be "
"configured for a variety of platforms.  The Keycloak SAML client adapter is "
"a standalone component that provides generic SAML 2.0 support for your web "
"applications.  There are no Keycloak server extensions built into it.  As "
"long as the Identity Provider (IdP) being communicated with supports "
"standard SAML, the Keycloak SAML client adapter should be able to integrate "
"with it."
