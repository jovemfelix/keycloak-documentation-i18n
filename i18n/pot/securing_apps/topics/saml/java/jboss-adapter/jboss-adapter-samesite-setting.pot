"Browsers are planning to set the default value for the `SameSite` attribute "
"for cookies to `Lax`. This setting means that cookies will be sent to "
"applications only if the request originates in the same domain. This "
"behavior can affect the SAML POST binding which may become non-functional. "
"To preserve full functionality of the SAML adapter, we recommend setting the "
"`SameSite` value to `None` for the `JSESSIONID` cookie created by your "
"container. Not doing so may result in resetting the container's session with "
"each request to {project_name}."

"To avoid setting the `SameSite` attribute to `None`, consider switching to "
"the REDIRECT binding if it is acceptable, or to OIDC protocol where this "
"workaround is not necessary."
