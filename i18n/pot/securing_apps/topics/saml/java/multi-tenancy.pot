"SAML offers the same functionality as OIDC for <<_multi_tenancy,Multi "
"Tenancy>>, meaning that a single target application (WAR) can be secured "
"with multiple {project_name} realms. The realms can be located on the same "
"{project_name} instance or on different instances."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"To do this, the application must have multiple `keycloak-saml.xml` adapter "
"configuration files."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"While you could have multiple instances of your WAR with different adapter "
"configuration files deployed to different context-paths, this may be "
"inconvenient and you may also want to select the realm based on something "
"other than context-path."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"{project_name} makes it possible to have a custom config resolver, so you "
"can choose which adapter config is used for each request. In SAML, the "
"configuration is only interesting in the login processing; once the user is "
"logged in, the session is authenticated and it does not matter if the "
"`keycloak-saml.xml` returned is different. For that reason, returning the "
"same configuration for the same session is the correct way to go."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"To achieve this, create an implementation of `org.keycloak.adapters.saml."
"SamlConfigResolver`. The following example uses the `Host` header to locate "
"the proper configuration and load it and the associated elements from the "
"applications's Java classpath:"
