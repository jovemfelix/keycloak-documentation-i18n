"When {project_name} is used as the IDP, it is possible to use the built in "
"role mappers to map any roles before adding them to the SAML assertion. "
"However, the SAML adapters can be used to send SAML requests to third party "
"IDPs and in this case it might be necessary to map the roles extracted from "
"the assertion into a different set of roles as required by the SP. The "
"`RoleMappingsProvider` SPI allows for the configuration of pluggable role "
"mappers that can be used to perform the necessary mappings."

"{project_name} includes a `RoleMappingsProvider` implementation that "
"performs the role mappings using a `properties` file. This provider is "
"identified by the id `properties-based-role-mapper` and is implemented by "
"the `org.keycloak.adapters.saml.PropertiesBasedRoleMapper` class."

"This provider relies on two configuration properties that can be used to "
"specify the location of the `properties` file that will be used. First, it "
"checks if the `properties.file.location` property has been specified, using "
"the configured value to locate the `properties` file in the filesystem. If "
"the configured file is not located, the provider throws a "
"`RuntimeException`. The following snippet shows an example of provider using "
"the `properties.file.configuration` option to load the `roles.properties` "
"file from the `/opt/mappers/` directory in the filesystem:"

"load the file from `/WEB-INF/role-mappings.properties` by default. Failure "
"to load the file from the resource will result in the provider throwing a "

"The `properties` file can contain both roles and principals as keys, and a "

"maps to an empty role, it is discarded. If it maps to a set of one ore more "
"different roles, then these roles are set in the result set. If no mapping "
