#. type: Plain text
msgid "If you want to use SAML with a Java servlet application that doesn't have an adapter for that servlet platform, you can opt to use the servlet filter adapter that {project_name} has.  This adapter works a little differently than the other adapters.  You still have to specify a `/WEB-INF/keycloak-saml.xml` file as defined in the <<_saml-general-config,General Adapter Config>> section, but you do not define security constraints in _web.xml_.  Instead you define a filter mapping using the {project_name} servlet filter adapter to secure the url patterns you want to secure."
