msgid "Java Servlet Filter Adapter"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "If you are deploying your Java Servlet application on a platform where there is no {project_name} adapter you opt to use the servlet filter adapter.  This adapter works a bit differently than the other adapters. You do not define security constraints in web.xml.  Instead you define a filter mapping using the {project_name} servlet filter adapter to secure the url patterns you want to secure."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "Backchannel logout works a bit differently than the standard adapters.  Instead of invalidating the HTTP session it marks the session id as logged out.  There's no standard way to invalidate an HTTP session based on a session id."

By default no skipPattern is configured."
