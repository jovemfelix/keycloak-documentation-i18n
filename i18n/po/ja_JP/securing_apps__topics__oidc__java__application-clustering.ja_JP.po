msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "Hosted on same domain as {project_name}"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "Dealing with clustering is not quite as simple as for a regular application. Mainly due to the fact that both the browser and the server-side application sends requests to {project_name}, so it's not as simple as enabling sticky sessions on your load balancer."

msgid "Stateless token store"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "By default, the web application secured by {project_name} uses the HTTP session to store security context. This means that you either have to enable sticky sessions or replicate the HTTP session."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "As an alternative to storing the security context in the HTTP session the adapter can be configured to store this in a cookie instead. This is useful if you want to make your application stateless or if you don't want to store the security context in the HTTP session."

msgid "To use the cookie store for saving the security context, edit your applications `WEB-INF/keycloak.json` and add:"

msgid "One limitation of using the cookie store is that the whole security context is passed in the cookie for every HTTP request. This may impact performance.\n"
msgstr ""

#. type: delimited block -
#, no-wrap
msgid "Another small limitation is limited support for Single-Sign Out. It works without issues if you init servlet logout (HttpServletRequest.logout) from the\n"
"application itself as the adapter will delete the KEYCLOAK_ADAPTER_STATE cookie. However, back-channel logout initialized from a different application isn't\n"
"propagated by {project_name} to applications using cookie store. Hence it's recommended to use a short value for the access token timeout (for example 1 minute).\n"

msgid "Relative URI optimization"
msgstr ""

#. type: delimited block -
msgid "In deployment scenarios where {project_name} and the application is hosted on the same domain (through a reverse proxy or load balancer) it can be convenient to use relative URI options in your client configuration."
msgstr ""

#. type: delimited block -
msgid "With relative URIs the URI is resolved as relative to the URL of the URL used to access {project_name}."
msgstr ""

#. type: delimited block -
msgid "For example if the URL to your application is `$$https://acme.org/myapp$$` and the URL to {project_name} is `$$https://acme.org/auth$$`, then you can use the redirect-uri `/myapp` instead of `$$https://acme.org/myapp$$`."

#. type: delimited block -
msgid "For example the way backchannel logout works is:"
msgstr ""

#. type: delimited block -
msgid ". User sends logout request from one application . The application sends logout request to {project_name} . The {project_name} server invalidates the user session . The {project_name} server then sends a backchannel request to application with an admin url that are associated with the session . When an application receives the logout request it invalidates the corresponding HTTP session"

msgid "Registration of application nodes"

msgid "The previous section describes how {project_name} can send logout request to node associated with a specific HTTP session.  However, in some cases admin may want to propagate admin tasks to all registered cluster nodes, not just one of them.  For example to push a new not before policy to the application or to logout all users from the application."
msgstr ""

#. type: delimited block -
msgid "In this case {project_name} needs to be aware of all application cluster nodes, so it can send the event to all of them.  To achieve this, we support auto-discovery mechanism:"

". The request may be re-sent to {project_name} in configured periodic intervals\n"
". If the {project_name} server doesn't receive a re-registration request within a specified timeout then it automatically unregisters the specific node\n"
". The node is also unregistered in {project_name} when it sends an unregistration request, which is usually during node shutdown or application undeployment.\n"
