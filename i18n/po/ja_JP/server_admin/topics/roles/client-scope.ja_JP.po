"When an OIDC access token or SAML assertion is created, all the user role "
"mappings of the user are, by default, added as claims within the token or "
"assertion.  Applications use this information to make access decisions on "
"the resources controlled by that application.  In {project_name}, access "
"tokens are digitally signed and can actually be re-used by the application "
"to invoke on other remotely secured REST services.  This means that if an "
"application gets compromised or there is a rogue client registered with the "
"realm, attackers can get access tokens that have a broad range of "
"permissions and your whole network is compromised.  This is where _client "
"scope_ becomes important."

"_Client scope_ is a way to limit the roles that get declared inside an "
"access token.  When a client requests that a user be authenticated, the "
"access token they receive back will only contain the role mappings you've "
"explicitly specified for the client's scope.  This allows you to limit the "
"permissions each individual access token has rather than giving the client "
"access to all of the user's permissions.  By default, each client gets all "
"the role mappings of the user.  You can view this in the `Scope` tab of each"
" client."

"You can see from the picture that the effective roles of the scope are every"
" declared role in the realm.  To change this default behavior, you must "
"explicitly turn off the `Full Scope Allowed` switch and declare the specific"
" roles you want in each individual client.  Alternatively, you can also use "
"<<_client_templates, client templates>> to define the scope for a whole set "
"of clients."
