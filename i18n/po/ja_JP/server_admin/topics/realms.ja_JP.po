"A realm manages a set of users, credentials, roles, and groups.  A user "
"belongs to and logs into a realm.  Realms are isolated from one another and "
"can only manage and authenticate the users that they control.  One "
"{project_name} deployment can define, store, and manage as many realms as "
"there is space for in the database.  When deciding whether to have one or "
"more realms think about what kind of isolation you want to have for your "
"users and applications.  For example, you might define a realm for the "
"employees of your company and have a separate realm for your customers.  You "
"employees would log into the employee realm and only be able to visit "
"internal company applications.  Customers would log into the customer realm "
"and only be able to interact with customer-facing apps.  In this section "
"you'll learn some basics about realm creation and configuration."
