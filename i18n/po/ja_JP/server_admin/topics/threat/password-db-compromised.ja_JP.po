#. type: Plain text
msgid "{project_name} does not store passwords in raw text.  It stores a hash of them using the PBKDF2 algorithm.  It actually uses a default of 20,000 hashing iterations! This is the security community's recommended number of iterations.  This can be a rather large performance hit on your system as PBKDF2, by design, gobbles up a significant amount of CPU.  It is up to you to decide how serious you want to be to protect your password database."
