"If you do not use SSL/HTTPS for all communication between the {project_name} "
"auth server and the clients it secures, you will be very vulnerable to man "
"in the middle attacks.  OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect uses access tokens for "
"security.  Without SSL/HTTPS, attackers can sniff your network and obtain an "
"access token.  Once they have an access token they can do any operation that "
"the token has been given permission for."

"{project_name} has <<_ssl_modes,three modes for SSL/HTTPS>>.  SSL can be "
"hard to set up, so out of the box, {project_name} allows non-HTTPS "
"communication over private IP addresses like localhost, 192.168.x.x, and "
"other private IP addresses.  In production, you should make sure SSL is "
"enabled and required across the board."

"On the adapter/client side, {project_name} allows you to turn off the SSL "
"trust manager.  The trust manager ensures identity the client is talking "
"to.  It checks the DNS domain name against the server's certificate.  In "
"production you should make sure that each of your client adapters is "
"configured to use a truststore.  Otherwise you are vulnerable to DNS man in "
"the middle attacks."
