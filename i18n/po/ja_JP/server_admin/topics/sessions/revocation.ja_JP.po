"You can only set a time-based revocation policy.  The console allows you to "
"specify a time and date where any session or token issued before that time "
"and date is invalid.  The `Set to now` will set the policy to the current "
"time and date.  The `Push` button will push this revocation policy to any "
"registered OIDC client that has the {project_name} OIDC client adapter "
"installed."
