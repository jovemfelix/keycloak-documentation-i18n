msgid "It is often useful for an admin to impersonate a user.  For example, a user may be experiencing a bug in one of your applications and an admin may want to impersonate the user to see if they can duplicate the problem.  Admins with the appropriate permission can impersonate a user.  There are two locations an admin can initiate impersonation.  The first is on the `Users` list tab."

In both cases, the browser will be redirected to the impersonated user's User Account Management page."
