"This value specifies the number of times a password will be hashed before it "

"the rare case that a hacker gets access to your password database. Once they "
"have access to the database, they can reverse engineer user passwords.  The "
"industry recommended value for this parameter changes every year as CPU "
"power improves. A higher hashing iteration value takes more CPU power for "
"hashing, and can impact performance. You'll have to weigh what is more "
"important to you. Performance or protecting your passwords stores.  There "
"may be more cost effective ways of protecting your password stores."
