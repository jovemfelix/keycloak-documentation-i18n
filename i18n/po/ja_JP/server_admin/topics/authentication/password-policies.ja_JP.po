msgid "Password Policies"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "Each new realm created has no password policies associated with it.  Users can have as short, as long, as complex, as insecure a password, as they want.  Simple settings are fine for development or learning {project_name}, but unacceptable in production environments.  {project_name} has a rich set of password policies you can enable through the Admin Console."

This will add the policy in the table on the screen.  Choose the parameters for the policy.  Hit the `Save` button to store your changes."

The only built-in and default algorithm available is PBKDF2. See the link:{developerguide_link}[{developerguide_name}] on how to plug in your own algorithm. Note that if you do change the algorithm, password hashes will not change in storage until the next time the user logs in."

msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "This value specifies the number of times a password will be hashed before it is stored or verified. The default value is 20,000.  This hashing is done in the rare case that a hacker gets access to your password database. Once they have access to the database, they can reverse engineer user passwords.  The industry recommended value for this parameter changes every year as CPU power improves. A higher hashing iteration value takes more CPU power for hashing, and can impact performance. You'll have to weigh what is more important to you. Performance or protecting your passwords stores.  There may be more cost effective ways of protecting your password stores."
