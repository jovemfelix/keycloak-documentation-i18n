The server must handle CORS requests in a special way, otherwise the browser will not display or allow the request to be processed.  This protocol exists to protect against XSS, CSRF and other JavaScript-based attacks."

#. type: Plain text
msgid "{project_name} has support for validated CORS requests.  The way it works is that the domains listed in the `Web Origins` setting for the client are embedded within the access token sent to the client application.  The client application can then use this information to decide whether or not to allow a CORS request to be invoked on it.  This is an extension to the OIDC protocol so only {project_name} client adapters support this feature.  See link:{adapterguide_link}[{adapterguide_name}] for more information."
