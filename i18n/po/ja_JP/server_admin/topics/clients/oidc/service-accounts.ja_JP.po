"Each OIDC client has a built-in _service account_ which allows it to obtain "
"an access token.  This is covered in the OAuth 2.0 specifiation under "
"<<_client_credentials_grant,Client Credentials Grant>>.  To use this feature "
"you must set the <<_access-type, Access Type>> of your client to "
"`confidential`.  When you do this, the `Service Accounts Enabled` switch "
"will appear.  You need to turn on this switch.  Also make sure that you have "
"configured your <<_client-credentials, client credentials>>."

"To use it you must have registered a valid `confidential` Client and you "
"need to check the switch `Service Accounts Enabled` in {project_name} admin "
"console for this client.  In tab `Service Account Roles` you can configure "
"the roles available to the service account retrieved on behalf of this "
"client.  Don't forget that you need those roles to be available in Scopes of "
"this client as well (unless you have `Full Scope Allowed` on). As in normal "
"login, roles from access token are the intersection of scopes and the "
"service account roles."

"The REST URL to invoke on is `/auth/realms/{realm-name}/protocol/openid-"

"post the client credentials.  By default, client credentials are represented "
"by clientId and clientSecret of the client in `Authorization: Basic` header, "
"but you can also authenticate the client with a signed JWT assertion or any "
"other custom mechanism for client authentication.  You also need to use the "
"parameter `grant_type=client_credentials` as per the OAuth2 specification."
