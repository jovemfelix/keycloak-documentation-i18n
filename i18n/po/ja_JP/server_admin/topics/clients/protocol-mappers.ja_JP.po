msgid "Applications that receive ID Tokens, Access Tokens, or SAML assertions may need or want different user metadata and roles.  {project_name} allows you to define what exactly is transferred.  You can hardcode roles, claims and custom attributes.  You can pull user metadata into a token or assertion.  You can rename roles.  Basically you have a lot of control of what exactly goes back to the client."
