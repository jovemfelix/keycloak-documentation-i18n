"Groups in {project_name} allow you to manage a common set of attributes and "
"role mappings for a set of users.  Users can be members of zero or more "
"groups.  Users inherit the attributes and role mappings assigned to each "
"group.  To manage groups go to the `Groups` left menu item."

"Groups are hierarchical.  A group can have many subgroups, but a group can "
"only have one parent.  Subgroups inherit the attributes and role mappings "
"from the parent.  This applies to the user as well.  So, if you have a "
"parent group and a child group and a user that only belongs to the child "
"group, the user inherits the attributes and role mappings of both the parent"
" and child.  In this example, we have a top level `Sales` group and a child "
"`North America` subgroup.  To add a group, click on the parent you want to "
"add a new child to and click `New` button.  Select the `Groups` icon in the "
"tree to make a top-level group.  Entering in a group name in the `Create "
"Group` screen and hitting `Save` will bring you to the individual group "
"management page."
