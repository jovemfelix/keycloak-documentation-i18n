msgid "Each realm created on the {project_name} has a dedicated Admin Console from which that realm can be managed.  The `master` realm is a special realm that allows admins to manage more than one realm on the system.  You can also define fine-grained access to users in different realms to manage the server.  This chapter goes over all the scenarios for this."
