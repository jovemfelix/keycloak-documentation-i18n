"Our `PropertyFileUserStorageProvider` example is bit contrived. It is "
"hardcoded to a property file that is embedded in the jar of the provider. "
"Not very useful at all. We might want to make the location of this file "
"configurable per instance of the provider. In other words, we might want to "
"reuse this provider mulitple times in multiple different realms and point to"
" completely different user property files. We'll also want to perform this "
"configuration within the administration console UI."

"The `UserStorageProviderFactory` has additional methods you can implement "
"that handle provider configuration. You describe the variables you want to "
"configure per provider and the administration console automatically renders "
"a generic input page to gather this configuration. When implemented, "
"callback methods also validate the configuration before it is saved, when a "
"provider is created for the first time, and when it is updated. "
"`UserStorageProviderFactory` inherits these methods from the "
"`org.keycloak.component.ComponentFactory` interface."
