msgid "Standalone operating mode is only useful when you want to run one, and only one {project_name} server instance.  It is not usable for clustered deployments and all caches are non-distributed and local-only.  It is not recommended that you use standalone mode in production as you will have a single point of failure.  If your standalone mode server goes down, users will not be able to log in.  This mode is really only useful to test drive and play with the features of {project_name}"
