"You can log out of a web application in multiple ways.  For Java EE servlet "
"containers, you can call HttpServletRequest.logout(). For other browser "
"applications, you can redirect the browser to `$$http://auth-server/auth/"
"realms/{realm-name}/protocol/openid-connect/logout?"
"redirect_uri=encodedRedirectUri$$`, which logs you out if you have an SSO "
"session with your browser."
