"{project_name} client adapters are libraries that makes it very easy to "
"secure applications and services with {project_name}. We call them adapters "
"rather than libraries as they provide a tight integration to the underlying "
"platform and framework. This makes our adapters easy to use and they require "
"less boilerplate code than what is typically required by a library."
