msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "There are multiple ways you can logout from a web application.  For Java EE servlet containers, you can call `HttpServletRequest.logout()`. For any other browser application, you can point the browser at any url of your web application that has a security constraint and pass in a query parameter GLO, i.e. `$$http://myapp?GLO=true$$`.  This will log you out if you have an SSO session with your browser."

#. type: Plain text
msgid "Internally, the SAML adapter stores a mapping between the SAML session index, principal name (when known), and HTTP session ID.  This mapping can be maintained in JBoss application server family (Wildfly 10/11, EAP 6/7) across cluster for distributable applications. As a precondition, the HTTP sessions need to be distributed across cluster (i.e. application is marked with `<distributable/>` tag in application's `web.xml`)."

msgid "If the session cache of the deployment is named `_deployment-cache_`, the cache used for SAML mapping will be named as `_deployment-cache_.ssoCache`. The name of the cache can be overridden by a context parameter `keycloak.sessionIdMapperUpdater.infinispan.cacheName`. The cache container containing the cache will be the same as the one containing the deployment session cache, but can be overridden by a context parameter `keycloak.sessionIdMapperUpdater.infinispan.containerName`."

msgid "By default, the configuration of the SAML mapping cache will be derived from session cache. The configuration can be manually overridden in cache configuration section of the server just the same as other caches."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "Currently, to provide reliable service, it is recommended to use replicated cache for the SAML session cache.  Using distributed cache may lead to results where the SAML logout request would land to a node with no access to SAML session index to HTTP session mapping which would lead to unsuccessful logout."

msgid "Special handling is needed for handling sessions that span multiple data centers. Imagine the following scenario:"

msgid "Login requests are handled within cluster in data center 1."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "Admin issues logout request for a particular SAML session, the request lands in data center 2."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "The data center 2 has to log out all sessions that are present in data center 1 (and all other data centers that share HTTP sessions)."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "To cover this case, the SAML session cache described <<_saml_logout_in_cluster,above>> needs to be replicated not only within individual clusters but across all the data centers e.g.  https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_Data_Grid/6.6/html/Administration_and_Configuration_Guide/chap-Externalize_Sessions.html#Externalize_HTTP_Session_from_JBoss_EAP_6.x_to_JBoss_Data_Grid[via standalone Infinispan/JDG server]:"

msgid "Once remote store is found to be present on SAML session cache during deployment, it is watched for changes and the local SAML session cache is updated accordingly."
